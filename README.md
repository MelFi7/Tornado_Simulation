The attached document displays an estimation of the probability distribution of the occurrence of Thousand Year Tornadoes 
in a time period of 1000 years. This was conducted by utilising unifomely generated random values as simulated time series of 
thousand year event occurrencies. This study was conducted in R and documented using R Markdown.
